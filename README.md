## C195 Software II
The Purpose of this application is
to demonstrate advanced java techniques,
including connecting to a database and
using SQL to add, modify, and delete from
that database.

The program is an appointment manager
that keeps track of appointments and 
customers.  It will not let appointments
overlap, and it makes sure appointments
are within business hours. A report section
contains useful information at a glance.
